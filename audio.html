    <h2>Lossy and Lossless Audio Compression</h2> <br/>

    <h3>Lossless Audio Files</h3>

    <h4>Examples of lossless audio file types</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows Media Audio(WMA)
        <li>Audio Intechange File Format(AIFF)
          <li>MPEG-4 SLS
            <li>WAV
              <li>FLAC
              </ul> <br/>
      <h4>Why use lossless audio file formats?</h4>

        <p>Lossless compression doesn't discard any data but still reduces the size of the file greatly.<br/>
          In an audio file there is sound and silence. Lossless formats can compress the silence to nearly<br/> nothing in terms of space
          while keeping everything else the same. This is important because<br/> you know that you always have the same original music
          and that none of the sound quality is lost.</p> <br/>

          <h3>Lossy Audio Files</h3>

            <h4>Examples of lossy audio file types</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>MP3
                <li>Vorbis
                  <li>Windows Media Audio Lossy(WMA Lossy)
                    <li>Opus
                    </ul>

                <h4>How does lossy compression work?</h4>

                    <p>Lossy compression allows the file to be greatly reduced in size by removeing audio information and
                    simplifying the data.<br/> It works by removing some sounds or frequencies that aren't recognised as much and
                    therfore don't affect the quality much.</p>

                <h4>Why use lossy audio compression?</h4>

                    <p>Lossy compression is useful becuase it means that it takes up less space and is quicker to download or stream,<br/>
                    this is more preferable to use as nowadays people want everything done quickly.</p>
