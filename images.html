      <h3>The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</h3>
        <p>There is a certain point where a file can be compressed without losing any information and that is lossless compression,
        any further and you lose data, this is lossy compression.
        In a text or program file any data lost could cause curruption or serious damage so lossless compression is used, but
        in images some data can be removed without the eye noticing it so it would be preferable to use lossy compression so that
        the file size is reduced so the image can load quickly on websites.</p>

      <h3>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h3>
        <p>It's important for web designers to compress images on their websites as it takes a long time to load an image that
        is very big, because it has to download every byte and there are millions of bytes in a high quality image and downloading
        every single one of them would take longer than preferable.</p>

      <h3>The effects of lossy and lossless compression</h3>
        <p>Lossy compression will get rid of data that isnt as important as other data such as high frequencies in an image, this
        process is irreversible meaning you can't get the data back, as for lossless you cannot notice the difference even though
        the file size is reduced, and you can revert to the original image if needed.</p>
